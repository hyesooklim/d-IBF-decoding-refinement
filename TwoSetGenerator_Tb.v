//This testbench generates two sets, Set1.txt and Set2.txt.
//Random numbers are generated by LFSR.
//Set1 is the numbers starting from other than 0 until the size of Set1.
//Set2 is the numbers starting from S1Distinct until the size of Set2.
//Hence, Set1 has distinct elements at the front, and Set2 has distinct elements at the back.
